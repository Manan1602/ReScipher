```The door opened and he realised he had entered a huge shiny box. 

DaVinci: CHE DIAVOLO!

The doors suddenly closed on him, and he started feeling uneasy, the feeling of weightlessness surely didn’t help. Right when he felt he would pass out, the doors opened, and he stumbled out.
Trying to refocus his vision in what looked like a big dark room, his eyes fixated in the middle of the room. He found a table in the middle with a  Big Bright Blue Cube. The table itself looked like it had always been there but the cube looked like it had popped into existence just a second ago, radiating low buzzing sounds.

It felt like the world around him was in an unending pause and moving faster than light all at the same time. His horizon expanded beyond his visual cone, He started seeing his own delayed images coursing through time, able to feel, see and experience everything in the universe that has ever happened, ever will happen and ever could happen. 

And right then, everything started slowing down, rippling down to a pause through bends and warps, and then came a sudden jerk, a pause. He was standing in front of a table on which laid a device of divine appearance, with two tube-like things protruding from one end. The device had an image on it, asking him to insert the tubes in his ears, and so he hesitantly did. 

He started hearing some sounds, familiar yet very alien to him, a symphony from another world, listening on intently to the following music
