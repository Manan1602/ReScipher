```Before everything comes to an end
It is worth remembering how it all began
Talented were the ones chosen
the hopes of your people.
Like a distant lamp flickering in the desert
Yet brave you all were when the stakes were high even
alas! the ones who wander into darkness realise it often too later/
That being said doesn't mean it was a waste 
Ah! you served your purpose well
And don't make haste because  
Slow is the noose around your necks
Could you even manage the conflict amongst yourself, talking about conquering the galaxy 
A tiny droplet you are in an ocean unseen
Pursuit of wonder is it? or a vial of misery
Take a look around you, you are witnessing the god itself
Unless we want, there would be no end
Regardless, your end is certain
End is near, the end is near
Doomsday you may call it if it suits your feeble minds
For even the end might end, could be one or maybe two
