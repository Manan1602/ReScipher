```The phrase, that phrase, it stayed on with him throughout, he continued to live by it, to follow it through all his adventures, his careers, for as long as he lived. 
After what seemed like months, DaVinci woke up after a whole day’s nap, and so as to not forget everything that he got to witness, the new machines and functionalities, he started to write it all down. He knew he had to keep account of all he saw and help the people of his era evolve further. He wrote about his journey and all the gadgets and equipment he saw on his journey in 4 notebooks called the “CODEX LEICESTER” which to this day are nowhere to be found, all in a complete set. The current estimated net worth of just one of his notebooks is $30.8M People of his era never believed what he said about his journey and thought of his new designs as rubbish and just drawings. Little did they know that in the near future, DaVinci would be deemed to be ahead of his time, and for a reason!```
