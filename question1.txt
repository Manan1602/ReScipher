```It was the beginning of one of his many careers, a young Leonardo DaVinci, decreed by the king to use the river system of his empire as a defence mechanism. He went on a search to find faraway lands, to map it all out for better understanding and planning.
This was also around the time when daVinci’s inner scientist had begun budding, and he started his research for finding other obscure forms of life on earth. He built all kinds of equipment for this, carrying them everywhere so he didn’t miss out on any signal, any life form, even when he was working on his other projects.

During one of his explorations for the river system on the cold night of 1st December 1473, he came across an unusual distant sound 

DaVinci: Cavolo! Something doesn't look right with the LEO Detector (Life and Energy Occurrence). I have to follow it through because how else is the story going to progress.

As he neared the vibrations, his equipment started breaking apart. He knew he had found something absolutely exceptional.

There stood in front of him, a huge door, unlike anything any human would’ve seen, guarding the sound causing harm to the machinery. The door, lit up around with an unusual glow, intriguing him further.

DaVinci: hmm, the middle of the fourth quarter of the day, the glow and the sound seem to have stabilised, let me get Zenith, my tallest device close to the door. Zenith seems to be pointing directly upwards. Let me focus Zenith's output on the door.
Suddenly a keyboard pops up, the door morphs into a display
